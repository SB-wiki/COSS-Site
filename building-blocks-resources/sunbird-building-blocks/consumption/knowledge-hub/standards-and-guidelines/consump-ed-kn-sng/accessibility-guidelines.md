# Accessibility-Guidelines

**Accessibility**  is the inclusive set of engineering/solutioning practices to ensure there are no barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, website on the internet by people with physical disabilities, situational disabilities, and socio-economic restrictions on bandwidth and speed.

Following needs are addressed as part of accessibility:

* Cognitive
* Seizure
* Visual
* Motor
* Auditory

As part of our Efforts, the Accessibility has been divided into two phases :

a) Product Accessibility

b) Content Accessinility

#### Product Accessibility

The fundamental Guidelines are derived from WCAG 2.1 guidelines. We are currently using these guidelines as base to formulate the guidelines.

* Accessibility should not be seen as a separate Engineering/QA effort by contributors.
* AXE Auditor Reports to be published by each contributor at the end of release.
* QA to include the test cases of Accessibility as part of main test cases. Regression report to be published on Accessibility across app and web site.
* Each Contributor to provide the roadmap of achieving accessibility compliance.

#### Content Accessibility

Content Accessibility refers to wide variety of contents in the platform contributed as part of Vidyadaan and Creation Workflows in Portal.

1.  Any Players contributed should have additional intelligence necessary to enable accessibility of content.

    Ex: Html Generated content like ECML, QuML Players can have an option of Accessibility mode available by default.
2.  Any asset generated in the platform should have relevant guidelines to ensure creators are nudged to create Accessible content.

    Ex: Content like PDF should have a clear guidelines on Do's/ Dont’s of creating pdf. Ability for creator to explicitly declare a content to be non-accessible would be desirable.
3. Image Based Based Questions in ECML/QuML can get explicitly marked as “Non Accessible“ and relevant warning has to produced to users.
