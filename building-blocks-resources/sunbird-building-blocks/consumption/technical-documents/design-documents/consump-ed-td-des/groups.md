#### Activity Creation Form Config (Against Version)

Any Form Configs associated with the config will completely gets driven by backend metdata to associate forms. There is a generic Abstracted Library being built called as SB-forms. Please refer the link below:

### Back End Design

GroupCassandra

```js
{
  "id": uuid, // PARTITION key
  "name": human_friendly_name, // need not be unique [Indexed]
  "activities": "[{
         "activity_id":  "activityId" //Extra Added.
  }]", // MAP [NO index created. No need to query specific] 
  "createdBy": uuid,
  "groupActivities":[], //Extra Added
  "createdOn": timestamp,
  "updatedBy": uuid,
  "updatedOn": timestamp,
  "status": "active", "inactive",
  "joinStrategy": InvitationOnly, Moderation - TBD
}
PRIMARY_KEY(id, name)
```

Groups can be deleted only by the creator, not by the admin.

ElasticSearch Solution 1:

The idea is to try eliminate ES. We will start doing reads directly from primary database.

activities is expanded as map. All other details flow to ES.

Solution 2:

Have a separate table meant to have multiple information sourced with a content.

Activity\_DataCassandra

```js
{
  "id": activity_id/plugin_id, 
  "activityInstanceId" : "do_id1",
  "type": "Course"
  "validity" : 
  "data": {
               "name": "The big bang theory",
               "orgName": ""
               
          // Extra Meta} // Not indexed, just serves as a placeholder to store any runtime data.
}
PRIMARY_KEY(id, activityInstanceId)
```

Group\_MemberCassandra

```js
{
  "id": group_uuid, // PARTITION key
  "memberId": userId // This is not an array, because we need to capture information who added, when added etc
  "role": [
      "isAdmin", "isMember", "// We can add moderator"
  ],
  "addedBy": uuid,
  "addedOn": timestamp,
  "removedBy": uuid,
  "removedOn": timestamp,
  "updatedBy": uuid,
  "updatedOn": timestamp
}
PRIMARY_KEY(id, role, memberId)
```

Plugin RegistryCassandra

```js
{
    "id": plugin_instance_id, // PARTITION key
    "ver": "1.0",
    "isActive": boolean,
    "shortId": "org.ekstep.launcher",
    "author": "string", // Default to "Sunbird"
    "description": "",
    "publishedDate": "",
    "data": { 
    } 
}
PRIMARY_KEY(id, author, isActive)
```
