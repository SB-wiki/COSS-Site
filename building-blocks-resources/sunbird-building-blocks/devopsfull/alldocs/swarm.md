# Swarm

* **Docker Swarm**
  * Swarm makes sure, at any point of time, we have the state defined
  * When a container health-check fails for n times, swarm restarts the container
  * If a node become unresponsive swarm will reschedule the containers in active nodes
  * Networking via iptables, called overlay network
  * **packets travel:** container → docker bridge network → iptables → ipvs → second host ...

* **Creating a service in Docker Swarm**
