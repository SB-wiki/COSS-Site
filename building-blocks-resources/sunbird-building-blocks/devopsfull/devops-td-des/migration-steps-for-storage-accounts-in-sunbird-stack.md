# Migration-Steps-for-storage-accounts-in-Sunbird-Stack

## Storage account Migrations and refactoring

Its Great to know that **we don’t have 1500+ variables but only 14 variables now in sunbird, related to storage accounts** like name, keys, sas in the ansible code and no cross reference apart from container details.

### Create 2 storage Accounts for private application contents and one management account to store backups and other devops related code, Don't touch the storage account with public contents and druid contents.

\* Follow the below naming convention to create storage account, NOTE: organisation and env are variables

\{{organisation\}}\{{env\}}management

\{{organisation\}}\{{env\}}private

\* Create a generic storage account for all the environments to store build artifacts for jenkins, this is a one time activity for all the environments in a particular organisation.

\{{organisation\}}artifact

\* Keep the druid storage account and key as and make sure the container is private

\* Remove all the reference variables related to storage account from CORE/KnowledgePlaform/DataPipeline\[Common.yml/Secrets.yml] from the private github repo.

* Migrate the storage containers across storage accounts \[container with private ACL to be in private storage account, public should left as is]as per the design document\[[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S5ivpL4DerR4i0YIPkms17K6wv0Y9uf5rguSVB\_2\_d8/edit#gid=1341452876%5D](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S5ivpL4DerR4i0YIPkms17K6wv0Y9uf5rguSVB\_2\_d8/edit#gid=1341452876%5D)
* Generate SAS token for management, public, artifacts and private storage account with CRUD operations

## CORE

## Deploy below kubernetes services

badger

cert

knowledge-mw-service

learner

lms

player-service

print

## Build,Artifact upload and deploy for cassandra to check artifact upload.

## KP

## Kill the samza jobs and delete folders and Deploy below Samza jobs for LP

collection-migration

qrcode-image-generator

post-publish-processor

publish-pipeline.properties

asset-enrichment

Deploy Learning-service

## DP

## Keep the media service storage account as is don't touch it

provision Spark - bashrc and /etc/environment changes for spark server changes

Spark data product deployment - scripts/start-jobmanager.sh - change the reports container and other stuff

* data products deploy

Secor deployment - /mount/secorjobs/

* deploy secor jobs

druid - leave as is!!

Analytics API provision - .bashrc, /etc/environment and /home/analytics/sbin/servicify-process.sh file

Adhoc python scripts - taking env from spark server environment variables.

### Update all these jobs to use the latest backup tag for below jobs in opsAdministration Folder, if requred migrate the jobs from dev and provide vaild schedule to run backups.

* ) Core ES
* ) LOG ES
* ) Composite ES
* ) Cassandra CORE
* ) Cassandra KP
* ) Cassandra DP
* ) Neo4j
* ) Redis LP
* ) Redis DP
* ) InfluxDB

Changes Made to achieve this in DevOps automation code are as follows:-

* **KnowledgePlatform:** [https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-learning-platform/pull/956](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fproject-sunbird%2Fsunbird-learning-platform%2Fpull%2F956\&v=3)
