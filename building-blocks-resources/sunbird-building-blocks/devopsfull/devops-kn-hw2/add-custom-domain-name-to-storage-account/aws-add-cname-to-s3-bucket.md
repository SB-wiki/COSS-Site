# AWS---Add-cname-to-s3-bucket

Adding custom domain to s3 bucket involves below steps

1. Grant public read access to S3 bucket
2. Create ssl certs for the custom domain using ACM
3. Create CDN and map dns endpoint to custom domain

### Grant public read access to S3 Bucket

* Log in to AWS COnsole and open your S3 Management Console
* choose the bucket name from the **S3 buckets** list.
* The **Access** column beside the Bucket name tells you the access status of your buckets. The default value is ‘Buckets and objects not public
* head over to the **Permissions** tab and edit the **On** mode of the ‘Block all public access’ option. Uncheck that box and save your changes
* In the permission tab, move to the Bucket Policy section. There is a **Bucket Policy Editor** area, enter the code shown below and configure the bucket access permission.

```
{"Version": "2008-10-17",
"Statement": [{"Sid": "AllowPublicRead",
"Effect": "Allow",
"Principal": {
"AWS": "*"
},
"Action": "s3:GetObject",
"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/*"
}]}
```

Replace ‘YOUR-BUCKET-NAME’ in the code with your real bucket name.
