Cloud specific ansible role

| **Cloud Provider** | **Ansible Role**                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

* We will need to create a CSP specific ansible role which can perform tasks such as upload / download / delete of files and folders from CSP storage buckets etc.
* Take a look at one of the existing cloud provider role such as AWS / GCP to understand what all operations are required as part of the role.

Cloud specific Elasticsearch plugin

* We will need to create a CSP specific ansible role which can perform elasticsearch snapshot
* Take a look at one of the existing cloud provider role such as AWS / GCP to understand the snapshot approach
* Under the hood, we are using the cloud provider plugin for elasticsearch snapshot - [https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/6.8/repository.html](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/6.8/repository.html)
* The plugin gets installed and configured using the ansible role

Ansible tasks related to storage bucketsBelow is a sample block which uploads to AWS S3 bucket ([https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-devops/blob/release-5.1.0/ansible/artifacts-upload.yml#L30-L41](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-devops/blob/release-5.1.0/ansible/artifacts-upload.yml#L30-L41) )

```
    - name: upload artifact to aws s3
      include_role:
        name: aws-cloud-storage
        tasks_from: upload.yml
      vars:
        local_file_or_folder_path: "{{ artifact_path }}"
        s3_bucket_name: "{{ cloud_storage_artifacts_bucketname }}"
        s3_path: "{{ artifact }}"
        aws_default_region: "{{ cloud_public_storage_region }}"
        aws_access_key_id: "{{ cloud_artifact_storage_accountname }}"
        aws_secret_access_key: "{{ cloud_artifact_storage_secret }}"
      when: cloud_service_provider == "aws"
```

* In order to support a new CSP, we will need to add a similar block which can invoke the CSP specific roles and upload to CSP storage buckets
* Below is the list of files that need to be modified to include the CSP storage ansible role

```
ansible/bootstrap.yml
ansible/dial_upload-schema.yml

```

Ansible Variables Private Repo Templates

* All the cloud specific variables (for example, bucket name, access key, secret key etc.) are provided to adopters using ansible variable template files
* The ansible variable template files need to be updated to include CSP specific variables so that a user is aware on what variables need to be filled based on the cloud provider
* The templates are located here - [https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-devops/tree/release-5.1.0/private\_repo/ansible/inventory/dev](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-devops/tree/release-5.1.0/private\_repo/ansible/inventory/dev)
* An adopter updates all the files mentioned in the above url which also includes the cloud specific variables

#### Repository - [https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-learning-platform/](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-learning-platform/)

* The implementation is same as the previous section (no private repo template in this repo, its part of the previous section)
* Below is the list of files that require the changes
