# OpsAdministration-Jenkins-Jobs

OpsAdministration jenkins jobs are used mainly for operations such as database backup, creating new users to provide ssh access etc.

These jobs are split into three folders - Core, KP and DP. This is same as the structure of other jobs. They also work similar to other set of jobs.

The jobs are quite simple and do what the name implies and are self explanatory. For example, a job named CassandraBackup performs the data backup cassandra database.

The working of these jobs are also exactly similar to other jobs - There is a Jenkinsfile and a ansible role for each of these.

For more information on the Jenkinsfile and ansible roles, refer to the pipeline and playbook code. Few images below on how to check this -

* Go to the job

* Click on configure and find the repo and Jenkinsfile

* Go to repo and find the jenkinsfile and ansible playbook

* Check the ansible playbook to understand what it does

You can use any latest tag or branch to run these jobs. We recommend running the backup jobs from the following tag - [https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-devops/tree/tag-for-backups](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-devops/tree/tag-for-backups)

You will also find similar backup tag in other repositories [https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-learning-platform/tree/tag-for-backups](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-learning-platform/tree/tag-for-backups) and [https://github.com/Sunbird-Obsrv/sunbird-data-pipeline/tree/tag-for-backups](https://github.com/Sunbird-Obsrv/sunbird-data-pipeline/tree/tag-for-backups)

The backup jobs are run with a cronjob option on jenkins so that automated backups happen on a daily basis or based on the schedule. These can be modified as per need.

![](../../../../../DevOpsFull/devops-kn-hw2/images/storage/image-20221220-073338.png)There are other set of jobs which are used as part of a release. For example, GraylogMongoImport job will add new dashboards, alerts etc into graylog. These will be run as part of a release with the release tags.

Below is a one liner description for each of these jobs
