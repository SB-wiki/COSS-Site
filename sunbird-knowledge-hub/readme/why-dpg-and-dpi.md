# Why DPG & DPI ?

**DPG & DPI**

The world today is turning digital, smaller and faster by the day. Technology has taken over vast tracts of our lives, and is proving to be the single most significant catalyst driving sweeping change across society. However, the uptake of such advancements is not uniform over the world. Inclusive and effective impact will be seen only when the miracles laid out by emerging technology and applications deliver value to every deserving citizen, the world over. Creation of a toolkit that leads to equitable access to this new digital world takes on paramount importance in this context.

**SIMPLIFYING CHANGE**

Digital Public Goods and Infrastructure (DPG, DPI) are increasingly gathering global acceptance as one of the most sustainable and inclusive ways of driving digital innovation to solve societal issues at scale. The need for reliable public digital public infrastructure is more pronounced now than ever - as this will form the core that will ensure choice, access and equity across solutions and applications being rolled out in the digital domain. DPGs act as Lego blocks, enabling the DPI journey - leveraging of freely available standardized passive digital assets (software, specifications, content etc.) to build contextual and interoperable shared digital utilities (solutions/ systems) is what leads to establishment of digital rails for accelerated growth. This approach also paves a safe and sustainable path to the adoption of digital solutions - fostering an environment for healthy growth and market innovation under the umbrella of regulatory policies and guidelines stipulated by governments

**THE INDIA STORY**

India has successfully navigated several such population-scale challenges across various domains - including identity, benefits, credentials, finance as well as education, by employing DPI that was created using open source DPGs, to drive inclusive and exponential transformation that aligns technology, policy and markets.

The Indian model of utilization of digital public infrastructure to solve population scale challenges at unprecedented speed is leading to further similar research and applications the world over. Some inspiring stories from India that have grown to become digital differentiators include:

* the world's largest digital Identity infrastructure (MoSIP)
* the world's largest operational direct benefits transfer system (India achieving 80% bank account penetration in a mere 6 years, as opposed to the projected 46 years)
* digital data and credentials for citizens (DigiLocker)
* skilling and education (Diksha)
* real time payment infrastructure (UPI)

**VISION**

While infrastructure is laid out by the establishment, the key is in making it work for the individual. Common, interoperable digital rails lay a reliable and scalable foundation for growth to be driven by an open ecosystem. This will lead to accelerated growth and effective problem-solving across domains. The day is not far when we will witness sovereign interoperable networks that can power global networks - unleashing the power of technology to help solve at scale.

DPGs and DPIs are no miracle cure - these only form powerful toolkits. Generating a miracle using these involves application of the toolkit to one's context, and a vivid imagination of how it can be used to derive value.

Core tenets that anchor the DPG/ DPI approach to digital solutions, and make them eminently usable include:

* Well laid out technology and architecture principles
* Future-proof policies and frameworks with focus on data privacy and the individual
* Federated and reliable digital public infrastructure

These, when followed rigorously, ensure there are appropriate guard-rails laid out for contributing ecosystems and participating markets, leading to solutions that can generate value holistically.

DPG/ DPI is now seeing a global movement with the establishment of the [DPGA registry](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/), which has amplified efforts towards creation of standardized DPGs and toolkits to catalyze the efforts aimed at achieving global development goals

2\) How do these principles contribute to making digital solutions eminently usable?

These principles contribute to making digital solutions eminently usable by ensuring inclusivity, accessibility, and scalability. Open standards and interoperability foster a collaborative ecosystem, allowing various digital tools and platforms to work seamlessly together. This enhances the user experience and broadens the adoption of digital solutions globally, catering to diverse needs and contexts.

3\) What is the importance of future-proof policies and frameworks in the DPG/ DPI approach?

**The Importance of Future-Proof Policies and Frameworks in the DPG/ DPI Approach**

Future-proof policies and frameworks are crucial in the DPG/ DPI approach because they ensure the long-term relevance, reliability, and adaptability of digital solutions. These policies and frameworks help anticipate and mitigate potential challenges, keeping solutions effective amidst technological advancements and changes in user needs. They also facilitate continuous improvement and evolution, fostering sustainable development and widespread adoption.

4\) How does federated and reliable digital public infrastructure support DPG/DPI ecosystems?

**Federated and Reliable Digital Public Infrastructure in DPG/DPI Ecosystems**

Federated and reliable digital public infrastructure supports DPG/DPI ecosystems by enabling decentralized control and management, which enhances resilience and scalability. This approach allows various systems to interconnect and operate cohesively, fostering innovation and ensuring robust service delivery. It also ensures data security, privacy, and sovereignty, thereby building trust and promoting wider adoption of digital solutions.

5\) What role does the DPGA registry play in the global movement for standardized DPGs?

**The Role of the DPGA Registry in Standardizing DPGs**

The DPGA registry plays a pivotal role in the global movement for standardized Digital Public Goods (DPGs) by providing a centralized repository that lists and categorizes DPGs. This facilitates discoverability, encourages best practices, and helps ensure compliance with international standards. By fostering transparency and accountability, the registry supports the widespread adoption and scalability of DPG solutions, contributing to a more unified and efficient global digital ecosystem.

6\) How can standardized DPGs and toolkits contribute to achieving global development goals?

Standardized Digital Public Goods (DPGs) and toolkits contribute to achieving global development goals by providing scalable and interoperable solutions that can be tailored to meet diverse regional needs. They promote efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure equitable access to technology, thus aiding in addressing challenges such as poverty, health, education, and sustainability. By adhering to international standards, they foster collaboration and innovation, paving the way for comprehensive and sustainable development.
