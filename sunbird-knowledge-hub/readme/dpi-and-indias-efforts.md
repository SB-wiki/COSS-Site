India's Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) initiative focuses on creating an inclusive digital ecosystem benefiting all citizens. Key efforts include the development and implementation of platforms like Aadhaar for identity verification, Unified Payments Interface (UPI) for digital transactions, and DigiLocker for cloud-based document storage. These initiatives aim to streamline services, improve accessibility, and bolster the country's digital economy.
