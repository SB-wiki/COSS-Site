{% embed url="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eHantftZO1QAz9rKeudn7uUve5bOI-I9-DIUxk4yYa8/edit?usp=sharing" %}



The presentation focuses on Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) and India's efforts in building a large-scale, inclusive digital ecosystem. Here?s a summary

1. What is DPI and Why It Matters?

* Definition: DPI refers to a set of shared digital utilities (platforms/networks) based on interoperable open standards and operated under enabling rules to provide equal access to individuals and institutions.
* Purpose: DPIs aim to drive innovation, inclusion, competition, and societal benefits such as sovereignty, inclusion, productivity, and governance.
* Examples include global DPIs like the Internet and email.

2. Digital Public Goods (DPGs)

* DPGs are digital assets made freely available, such as open-source software, that help build DPIs more effectively.
* They accelerate DPI creation by providing foundational resources.

3. India's DPI Journey

* India has a diverse population of 1.4 billion people, with 22 official languages and over 1 billion mobile connections.
* In 2008, only 17% of Indians had bank accounts. However, with DPI efforts, the target was achieved in just six years, compared to an estimated 46 years.
* India's Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system has become the world's largest, transferring over $322 billion directly to people, saving over $27 billion in the process.

4. Key DPI Components in India

* Identity Infrastructure (Aadhaar): Over 1.35 billion IDs issued, enabling over 79 billion authentications and 13 billion e-KYC transactions.
* Real-Time Payment Infrastructure (UPI): Facilitates seamless payments with over 7.8 billion monthly transactions as of December 2022.
* Data & Credentialing Infrastructure (Digital Locker and Account Aggregator): Driving data-driven Summary of "Understanding Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) and India's Efforts" innovation with over 5.6 billion digitally verifiable certificates.

5. Account Aggregator Network

* A secure financial data network that allows individuals to share their financial data with consent, leading to better access to credit for small businesses and individuals.

6. Global Impact and Replicability

* India's DPI assets (protocols, software, policy templates) are freely available for other countries to use.
* There is a call for creating a global 'FINTERNET' to ensure global interoperability of financial networks.

7. Key Takeaway

* Digital Public Infrastructures can help create a more inclusive, innovative, and efficient society. India's success story showcases the potential of DPIs to bring transformative change at scale.
